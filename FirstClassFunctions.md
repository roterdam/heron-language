# First Class Functions #

In Heron functions are first class data types. They can be created at run-time, assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from functions.

The syntax for a first class function in Heron is similar to that of JavaScript:

```
var next = function(n : Int) : Int { 
  return n + 1; 
} 
```
