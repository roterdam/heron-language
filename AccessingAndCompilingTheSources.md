# Accessing and Compiling the Sources #

If you want to access and compile the latest source code from the SVN repository on Windows I suggest using [Microsoft Visual C++ Express](http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/) and [Tortoise SVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/).

For connecting to the SVN repository you can follow the [instructions here](http://code.google.com/p/heron-language/source/checkout).

If you just want to browse the source online [go here](http://code.google.com/p/heron-language/source/browse/trunk).
