# Zen of Heron #

Just like Time Peter's [Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) here are some of the Heron guiding principles:

  * Code must be correct before it can be made efficient
  * Code is for humans, not computers
  * Code should be self-documenting
  * There should be one obvious way to accomplish things
  * The obvious and most elegant way to do things should be sufficiently efficient.
  * It is more important that code is easy to read than it is to write
  * Code should not be ambiguous
  * Code should not contains superfluous constraints
  * Assumptions should be explicit rather than implicit
  * There should be as few constructs and operators as necessary (but no fewer)
  * It should be easy for the compiler to optimize code
  * The user should be given the tools to optimize code via macros and meta-programming
  * Programmers should be able to write elegant code without worrying about the compiler
  * Types annotations are useful, except when they aren't
  * Programming is the art of giving names to things
  * Try to use the most general abstraction possible
  * When code is reused it improves its reliability
